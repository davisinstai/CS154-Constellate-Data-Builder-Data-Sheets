## Project Description

The goals of this assignment are:
* To introduce you to sources of data for doing NLP (and in particular JSTOR).
* To introduce you to best practices for documenting data (and why they matter).

Here are the steps you should do to successfully complete this project:
1. From moodle, accept the assignment.
2. Open and set up a code space (install a python kernal and select it).
3. Complete the notebook and commit it to Github. Make sure to answer all questions! Also, complete the data_sheet.md file.
4. Edit the README.md file. Provide your name and your class year.
5. Commit your code often. We will take the last commit before the deadline as your submission of the project.

For extra credit:
* Find a data set that you might be interested in doing NLP on (for example, check out https://ldc.upenn.edu, or https://zenodo.com, or https://paperswithcode.com, or https://huggingface.co). Briefly describe the data set and what you might like to do with it.
* Use Voyant Tools to analyze the data set we created in Lab. Paste a screen shot into your Readme.
* Find a data set that has been used for NLP that you think is problematic (for example, it might be biased; or it might be collected without consent; or it might have personal data in it). Briefly describe the data set and explain why you think it is problematic. 
* Your other ideas are welcome! If you'd like to discuss one with Dr Stent, feel free.
